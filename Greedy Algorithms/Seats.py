Seats
Problem Description

There is a row of seats represented by string A. Assume that it contains N seats adjacent to each other. There is a group of people who are already seated in that row randomly. i.e. some are sitting together & some are scattered.

An occupied seat is marked with a character 'x' and an unoccupied seat is marked with a dot ('.')

Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each other, without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the total number of hops or jumps to move them should be minimum.

In one jump a person can move to the adjacent seat (if available).

NOTE: 1. Return your answer modulo 10^7 + 3.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000
A[i] = 'x' or '.'



Input Format
First and only argument is a string A of size N.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the minimum number of jumps required.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "....x..xx...x.."
Input 2:

 A = "....xxx"


Example Output
Output 1:

 5
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Here is the row having 15 seats represented by the String (0, 1, 2, 3, ......... , 14) 
                 . . . . x . . x x . . . x . . 
 Now to make them sit together one of approaches is -
                 . . . . . . x x x x . . . . .
 Steps To achieve this:
 1) Move the person sitting at 4th index to 6th index: Number of jumps by him =   (6 - 4) = 2
 2) Bring the person sitting at 12th index to 9th index: Number of jumps by him = (12 - 9) = 3
 So, total number of jumps made: 2 + 3 = 5 which is the minimum possible.

 If we other ways to make them sit together but the number of jumps will exceed 5 and that will not be minimum.
 
Explanation 2:

 They are already together. So, the cost is zero.
